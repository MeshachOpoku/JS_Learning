Language hide detail not enjoying.
No need to specify how program jump back and forth but while or do for construct [loop] will..
bit has to be put in chunk[values] to understand it.Vlues can number ,text  and other functions.
Assuming where values take over computer storage then there is need to put some where to free space .
Values of number eg 3
number use  64 bits to  store particular number.Similarly, given 64 binary
digits, is represented 10 raised to the power 64[That is 10^24] which is equals about 18 quintillion
(an 18 with 18 zeros after it).Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups
of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers.
What about negative .bit can be used to store decimal number and nonwhole and even decimas point . These has to be represented.
2.998e8 =2998 *[10 to the power 8] .This type of number has nbeen represented but taking 9 quadrillion (15 zeros) .So 9 quadrillion (15 zeros) goes  beyond 64 bit hence can not be represented.
many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them.

Operator s:
 % is remainderb operator  4%2=0 ; 7%2=1
  Arithmetic operation : use parentheses to escape if you donot know precendence of operators.
Special numbers:
Infinity is for large positive number while [-Infinity is for negative number].
NaN  is also around and stands for 'Not a number'.
String : 
here text are in enclosed content in quote[double quote,single quote ,back tick to make text].
eg `Hello`, 'Hello',"Hello"
/*Assignment**/ greeting =`Hello` 
Some character which cannot be put under quote should use backslash (\) 
eg in='Fan \n Games';
Another \' eg data= 'Akua's name is every where.'; console.log(data)/* output: Akua's name is every where.

To display \ n as test it must be like this [\"\\n\"]
eg sentence=" \\n\ is used in JS"; console.log(sentence)//output: \n is used in Javascript.
eg /*code*/ sentence=" \"\\n\"  is here"; console.log(sentence);//output: "\n"  is here.

String can not perfoerm calculation of any sort by can do contwentatio.JS sstrings uses 16 bits per string element.So some characters, such as many emoji, take
up two “character positions” in JavaScript strings.
example of concatenation 
/*code*/
concatText="Pen" + "is used in traditional school"; console.log(concatText);
/*code*/
news="Noon news" ; update=" is upcoming next"; console.log(news+update+"\nstay glued to your TV set");

Expression eg can number or whatever. eg 22 or any word . Like  sentences humanns use so is it in programming .
Semi-colon are need in Javascript.
binding = variable;
eg let HighTemperature="High";
   let  LowTemperature="Low"
  console.log(HighTemperature);
  console.log(LowTemperature)

Boolean
Tenary 
eg  console.log(false?1:0);

Empty values carry no information eg null and undefined
 
In binding a var is a keyword for declaring varible .
Variable can contain numbers but number should not start any variable and should not contain any puntuation  mark.
It  can contain dollar( $) and (_) underscore
eg $payment=69.00;
   _name="Kobi";

Nan [Not a Number] is nonsensical computation and is the only thing which does equals itself.
