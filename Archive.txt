Here things that came from God and Holy Spirit .I didn't know but I said them.

Focus[Concentration plus Consistency]:
In schools, learning is our delicacies.Children can be focused or not.Concentration and focus and consistent bring margin or marginalization in ,in people.

They lost what I said above[ that is focus and concentration]
A math tutor penetrated or  enterred classroom to give an assigment while I was teaching.Learners got distracted in the course.Some scribblings on the floor of the whiteboard revealed it 5 work- numbered homework for learners to take home.

Seeing them distracted ,some sayings flew into the atmosphere ,it was about the math tutor but for kids.
Assuming ,you start brushing teeth and mother said stop do not finish brushing ,come and iron my cloth, taking an iron ironing the cloth mother calls again, you in a jiff saying 'stop move to the other room sweep there to reveal the room spotless'.What will you say to your mother and with what rage will you speak in ?
Concentration with uncontrollable distraction can be tormenting and daunting!
They say 'Master of all trait is none'.
