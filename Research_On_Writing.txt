Meetup Activity:
Drew my mind to writing info when a speaking is 1/total_num provided is not well educated society else this is like the ratio and yet still some educated will enjoy they speech and  may want to refresh what was said yet is gone, the mind didnt keep for long.
Info was not stored in long term memory yet they were happy about what they need to do when talk show was ongoing. 
Most Ghanaians freely hear info with ears ,process and radiate with joy plus smile .
Incase  there is a meet up programme ,most Ghanaians leave such areas  with their mind empty and speech forgotten.Advice or recommendation or solution evaporate with heat into a thin air with no trace to it.
  They recoil back into their their hood or hole  in busy and noisy society.
They continue the same trend and pattern.Future remain blur for some due to the fact that they stick to old fashion technique  with no update. Stagnant ,we all are . 
There are some recommendations ,they can radiate light to demolish  the future which is blurred  and dark
  1. Write short note of information critical to improvement and development or ideas breaking grounds .
  2. Quit old fashion style and believe high level can be reached with high level  of discomfort ,practice and refactoring .
  3.  God and Bible should be learnt and applied[That is the future]
